I'm currently trying to wrap up some tunes! 2 synthwave tracks, you can check them out here:

- [Do What You Will](https://dak-music.bandcamp.com/track/do-what-you-will-demo)
- [Virtual Sun](https://dak-music.bandcamp.com/track/virtual-sun-demo)

I really struggle with finishing tracks as I'm a perfectionist but I've got to learn to let them go. What a process!
