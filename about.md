Ahoyhoy. I'm a web developer at [Bidvine](https://www.bidvine.com). My current focus there is migrating the site from Ember to React, though I'm hoping to move into more of an analytics role. In my spare time, I try to make video games, and I play some instruments.

Programming languages I've worked in:

- Javascript (full-stack; Node, Express, React, Ember, Vue)
- Python (random scripts, data sciience-y stuff)
- SQL
- C# (in conjunction with Unity)

I also did some Java stuff (for Android), C (for OpenCL), MATLAB (for numerical shenanigans), Golang, and Elixir.

Instruments I play:

- Banjo
- Piano (and the melodica!)
- Bass
- Drums

I used to play guitar and mandolin, but have given both of those up in favour of the banjo. Banjitars and banjolins are bastard instruments.

This is hosted through GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), with a modified version of the [Swift theme](https://github.com/pranavrajs/swift).

To fill up some room, here's my favourite astronomy/astrophysics-related photo, one of M87 and its accretion jet (in visible wavelengths!)

That accretion jet is 1.5 kiloparsecs long! In more reasonable units, that's about *29 quadrillion miles!* It would take light 4896 years to travel that distance. That's awesome!
