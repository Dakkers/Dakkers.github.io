My name's Dakota St. Laurent, and I'm a student at the University of Waterloo. I study applied math. I'm currently doing research in the field of parallel scientific computing with Python under the supervision of [Francis Poulin](https://uwaterloo.ca/poulin-research-group/). It's pretty cool. Starting in May, I'll be doing research in computational finance using GPUs under the supervision of [Justin Wan](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jwlwan/). To find out more about me or what I've worked on, check out my [actual homepage](http://stdako.com).

This blog is meant to host tutorials for either problems I've been stuck on for a while, or random things. If you're a programmer, I'm sure you've come across a problem that takes a lot of time to solve, and you had to go through several resources to piece things together. It's happened to me many times, so each post will (ideally) be a collection of those resources with a nice walkthrough to help you out.

This is hosted through GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), with a modified version of the [Swift theme](https://github.com/pranavrajs/swift).

To fill up some room, here's my favourite astronomy/astrophysics-related photo, one of M87 and its accretion jet (IN OPTICAL (i.e. VISIBLE) WAVELENGTHS!!!):

That accretion jet is 1.5 kiloparsecs long! In more reasonable units, that's about *29 quadrillion miles!* It would take light 4896 years to travel that distance. That's awesome!
