Hiya. I study applied mathematics at the University of Waterloo (B.Math. 2015). More importantly, I code. I'm a jack-of-all-trades and a master-of-none, but I program mostly in JavaScript and Python, focusing on web applications and numerical computation.

I've dabbled in many other languages, e.g. C, MATLAB, Go, Assembly, Java, across many different kinds of programming, e.g. back-end, Android, games, security, hardware. I like all of it, except Java, sometimes. To see what I've done, check out my [projects page](projects) or my [GitHub](https://github.com/SaintDako). You can also check out my [resume](http://saintdako.com/Dakota-StLaurent-resume.pdf).

Besides programming, I'm a bit of a music junkie. I also like video games, card games, TV/anime and I'm a huge fan of Japanese Mahjong, although I'm pretty bad at it.

This website is meant to host tutorials for either problems I've been stuck on for a while, or random things. If you're a programmer, I'm sure you've come across a problem that takes a lot of time to solve, and you had to go through several resources to piece things together. It's happened to me many times, so each post will (ideally) be a collection of those resources with a nice walkthrough to help you out.

This is hosted through GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), with a modified version of the [Swift theme](https://github.com/pranavrajs/swift).

To fill up some room, here's my favourite astronomy/astrophysics-related photo, one of M87 and its accretion jet (IN OPTICAL (i.e. VISIBLE) WAVELENGTHS!!!):

That accretion jet is 1.5 kiloparsecs long! In more reasonable units, that's about *29 quadrillion miles!* It would take light 4896 years to travel that distance. That's awesome!

For some filler, here's a great picture my good friend Jacky made:
