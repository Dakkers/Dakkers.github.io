Hi! I'm Dakota. I'm an incoming senior software engineer at [ApplyBoard](https://www.applyboard.com/). I was previously a senior software developer at [Bidvine](https://www.bidvine.com/) where I led the migration from Ember to React and developed many, many other features.

In my spare time, I [make music](https://dak-music.bandcamp.com/) and I also do some game development. You can check out my first game on Steam called [Chessers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/868730) - it's a bastardized hybrid of chess and checkers.
