    Welcome to this dinky tool! It goes through all 12 keys at random; I use it to practice scales, chord types, etc. without developing muscle memory of moving around the circle of 5ths. You can hit Space/Enter to go to the next key, Esc/R to restart.

    Alternatively if your MIDI keyboard is plugged in when accessing this page, the lowest A on the keyboard will go to the next key and the highest C will restart.

    Lastly, if you use Chrome, the computer will speak to you so you don't have to look at the computer screen to see what key it is. :)
